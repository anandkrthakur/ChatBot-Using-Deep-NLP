ChatBot using Deep Learning &amp; Natural Language Processing

For dataset, kindly go to [Google Search](https://www.google.com) and type "cornell movie dialog corpus".

Click on the very first [link](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). (you can directly click on this link also to reach page)

Read about the "Cornell Movie-Dialog Corpus" under Description Section, then proceed to download the DATASET by clicking on "Zip File".

Upon downloading, you can extract the files to your local directory and dig around the file details on your system.

Project will be mainly dealing with 2[two] files, those are: (these are the main DATASETS for our ChatBot project)

- movie_lines
- movie_conversations

Rest you can keep for your referanece and if you are interested, I would request you to read files: (it will help you to understand our DATA much better)

- movie_titles_metadata
- movie_characters_metadata

Now I hope you have followed all the above steps and suggestions. Thus, let's move on to make our first ChatBot using Deep Learning &amp; Natural Language Processing

### Happy learning!!!
